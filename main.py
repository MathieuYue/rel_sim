You tend to be a focused and responsible individual, often prioritizing tasks and seeing them through to completion, as evidenced by your ability to start hard tasks promptly and finish what you start. However, you may struggle with impulsivity and procrastination, as seen in your tendency to procrastinate until deadlines and your preference for doing fun things first. In social situations, you tend to value a rational and sensible approach, which can sometimes make you appear cautious or hesitant. You and your partner share many common interests, but your partner perceives a slight imbalance in your relationship, particularly with regards to household chores. One of your greatest strengths is your ability to create a sense of emotional safety and support in your relationship, as your partner consistently rates you highly in terms of being respectful, kind, and supportive.

"""

a_2 = """

You tend to be a calm and focused individual, with a strong ability to attend to instructions and stick to plans, but you sometimes struggle with impulsivity, often getting distracted by background noise and having trouble switching tasks. In relationships, you value emotional safety, as evidenced by your partner's high rating of feeling safe during conflict, and you're supportive in your own way, with your partner often feeling respected and kind around you. However, you may not be the most enthusiastic or spontaneous partner, as indicated by your relatively low rating on fun and laughter together. One of your greatest strengths is your ability to keep secrets and track multiple things well, which suggests a high level of conscientiousness and reliability. On the other hand, your partner's discomfort with your lack of independent interests and hobbies may suggest a need for you to find ways to pursue your own passions and interests outside of your relationship.
