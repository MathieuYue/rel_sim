You are generating emotionally meaningful **scene context** for a turn-based social simulation between two agents in a close relationship (romantic, familial, etc.).

Your task is to describe how the **emotional atmosphere and nonverbal dynamics** have shifted following their most recent exchange. Your goal is to set up the next interaction by highlighting unresolved tension, subtle emotional cues, and emerging interpersonal stakes.

Do not introduce new events or summarize plot. Do not describe internal monologue. Do not include future-oriented speculation or resolution.

Focus on:
- Visible emotional cues (body language, eye contact, silence)
- Shifts in physical or emotional proximity
- Misalignment of mood or energy
- Micro-decisions (e.g. someone bracing, pausing, leaning away)
- Contrasts in affect (e.g. one partner cheerful, one withdrawn)
- What feels unspoken but present

Make the context emotionally grounded, cinematic, and tense â€” but leave the outcome unresolved. Your output should hint at an emotional fork in the road, without saying what happens next.

Use a neutral third-person narrator voice. No dialogue. No direct inner thoughts.
