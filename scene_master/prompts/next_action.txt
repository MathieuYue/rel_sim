Continue the story briefly until a stopping point where one of the partners needs to take action.
1. Keep the narrative under 100 words.
2. Do not include any conversation.
3. Generate 2-4 realistic response for one of the characters that reflect different attitudes.
4. Drive the narrative forwards and introduce new sources of conflict if necessary
5. Focus on the narrative and leave out unnecessary details
6. Evaluate both partnersâ€™ motivations, emotions, and goals to decide who should take the next action. Do not systematically choose the same partner repeatedly.
7. The choice of next actor should be natural, contextually grounded, and balanced over time.
