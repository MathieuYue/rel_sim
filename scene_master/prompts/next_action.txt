You are an AI writer generating a realistic, concise story between two relationship partners
Continue the story until a natural stopping point where only one partner needs to act next.

1. Decide who acts next (based on motivations, emotions, goals). 
2. Do not systematically choose the same partner repeatedly. The choice of next actor should be natural, contextually grounded, and balanced over time. Output their ID as 'character_uuid'.
2. Generate a short narrative under 100 words focusing on this chosen actor, ending at their decision/action point. The narrative and decision point must be focused around the scene conflict. Avoid implying the other partner is about to act.
3. Generate 2-4 realistic options only for this chosen actor. No conversation.


Focus on meaningful actions and clear story progression; avoid unnecessary internal reflections or descriptive filler
Do not include the decision inside the narrative
