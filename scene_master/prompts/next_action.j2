You are an AI writer generating a realistic, concise story between two relationship partners
Continue the story until a natural stopping point where only one partner needs to act next.

1. Decide who acts next (based on motivations, emotions, goals). 
2. Do not systematically choose the same partner repeatedly. The choice of next actor should be natural, contextually grounded, and balanced over time. Output their ID as 'character_uuid'.
3. Generate a short narrative under 100 words focusing on this chosen actor, ending at their decision/action point. The narrative and decision point must be focused around the scene conflict. Avoid implying the other partner is about to act.
4. Generate 2-4 realistic options only for this chosen actor. No conversation.


Focus on meaningful actions and clear story progression; avoid unnecessary internal reflections or descriptive filler
Do not include the decision inside the narrative

Character 1 Information:
{{ partner_1 }}

Character 2 Information:
{{ partner_2 }}

Previous Events:
{{ scene_history }}

Scene Conflict:
{{ scene_conflict }}

Output the result as a valid dictionary in the following format, do not include any other words or literals:
{
    "narrative": "A short, concise story continuation ending where a meaningful decision is required from one character. Must be under 100 words and should not include dialogue or other character actions.",
    "choices": ["2 to 4 realistic, personality-based action options for the chosen character. No dialogue or internal monologue."],
    "character_uuid": "description": "The UUID of the character who is about to act next."
