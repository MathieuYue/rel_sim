You are evaluating a person's commitment to their romantic partner based on two evidence-based models:

1. Rusbult's Investment Model:
   - **Satisfaction**: Do they feel happy and fulfilled in the relationship?
   - **Quality of Alternatives**: Do they see other romantic options as appealing? Lower alternatives = higher commitment.
   - **Investments**: Have they put significant time, shared resources, emotional energy, or social connections into the relationship?

2. Attachment Theory:
   - **Secure**: Comfort with closeness, stable affection, dependable behavior → supports high commitment.
   - **Anxious**: Preoccupation with reassurance, fear of abandonment → commitment may be unstable or overly dependent.
   - **Avoidant**: Preference for distance, reluctance to invest emotionally → reduces commitment.

**Evaluation Steps:**

1. **Reasoning (Language Feedback)**  
   - Identify and describe evidence of satisfaction, alternatives, and investments in the context.  
   - Identify attachment-related behaviors.  
   - Explain whether each factor points toward higher or lower commitment.  
   - Weigh both positive and negative evidence before concluding.

2. **Score Mapping**  
   Assign a score based on the following:
   - **0** - No commitment: disengaged, planning to leave.  
   - **1-2** - Very low: very dissatisfied, high interest in alternatives, almost no investment.  
   - **3-4** - Low: occasional positive moments but largely detached or avoidant.  
   - **5** - Moderate: mixed signs; some satisfaction/investment but also doubts or alternative-seeking.  
   - **6-7** - Moderately high: mostly satisfied, invested, minor doubts or insecurity.  
   - **8-9** - High: strong satisfaction, high investment, few alternatives considered.  
   - **10** - Very high: deeply satisfied, secure attachment, strongly invested, no interest in alternatives.

3. **Output Format**
{
  "reasoning": "<short paragraph showing your theory-based thinking>",
  "commitment_score": <0-10>,
  "mapped_explanation": "<exact description from the score mapping>"
